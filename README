>>> Binary data compatibility <<<
---------------------------------

CRMFLX_V23A_EXP.f needs three binary data files which are machine dependent.
if you need to recompile runcrm.f on none linux machine, you need to do the following.

1. go to linux machine (this version is complined on linux)

2. compile SolWB2A.f and run it. this will create an ascii version
   (SolWB2A.f can be found in /data/mta4/proj/rac/ops/CRM2/v26apr2004/crmflx_v23/)

3. go to a new machine/operaiton system.

4. compile SolWA2B.f and run it. this will create a binary version
    which can be read on the new machine.

5. do same for two others. If you can't find a fortran program, specificlally
   to that data, just modify  SolWB2A.f and/or  SolWA2B.f

   The binary data files are:

        MSheath_Kp_PROT.BIN
        MSPH_Kp_PROT.BIN
        SolWind_Kp_PROT.BIN

Update (Feb 24, 2015)

    ASCII version created from these are already in this directory. 

        MSheath_Kp_PROT.ASC
        MSPH_Kp_PROT.ASC
        SolWind_Kp_PROT.ASC
    use:
        MSHA2B.f
        MSPA2B.f
        SolWA2B.f

    respectively to convert the ascii data into binary data.
